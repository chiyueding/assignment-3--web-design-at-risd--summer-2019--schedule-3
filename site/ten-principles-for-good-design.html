      <div id="section-01" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">INNOVATIVE</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Is innovative. The possibilities for progression are not, by
 any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new 
opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always 
develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in
 itself.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-02" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">USEFUL</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Makes a product useful. A product is bought to be used. It 
has to satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic
 criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst 
disregarding anything that could detract from it.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-03" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">ASTHEITC</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Is aesthetic. The aesthetic quality of a product is integral
 to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an 
effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be
 beautiful.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-04" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">UNDERSTANDABLE</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Makes a product understandable. It clarifies the product’s 
structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its 
function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best, it is 
self-explanatory.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-05" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">UNOBSTRUSIVE</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Is unobtrusive. Products fulfilling a purpose are like 
tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their 
design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room 
for the user’s self-expression.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-06" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">HONEST</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Is honest. It does not make a product appear more 
innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt 
to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-07" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">LONG-LASTING</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Is long-lasting. It avoids being fashionable and therefore 
never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many 
years — even in today’s throwaway society.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="#section-08" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">THROUGH DOWN TO LAST DETAIL</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Is thorough down to the last detail. Nothing must be 
arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process 
show respect towards the consumer.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-09" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Is environmentally friendly. Design makes an important 
contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves 
resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the 
lifecycle of the product.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-10" class="align-start">
         <h2><span class="subtitle">AS LITTLE DESIGN AS POSSIBLE</span></h2>
         <p class="link-to-top"><a href="#">↑</a></p>
         <p>Is as little design as possible. Less, but better — because 
it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not 
burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</p>
